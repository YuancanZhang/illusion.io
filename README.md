# Getting start with Illusion.IO
Inspired by brainfart, I don't know what this project is for or heading towards, anyway try spinning up this on local to see some weird shit happening.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### Database
spin up database in docker
```
docker compose up -d
```
### BE server
spin up java server 
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## FE UI
spin up UI
```
npm start
```
